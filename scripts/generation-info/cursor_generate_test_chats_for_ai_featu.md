# Generate test chats for AI features
_Exported on 10/24/2025 at 14:41:23 CDT from Cursor (1.7.44)_

---

**User**

Here's a .json format to populate the database table of existing chats. Please use it to generate a set of chats suitable for testing the AI features of this project, between the Lieutenant hypothetical user and various individuals in his orbit. 
A minimum set of chats I want to see: 
* One which contains an OPORD for a company-level element which will be used for testing generation of a platoon-level WARNO
 * Another from the same Captain to the same Lieutenant containing an addendum suitable for generation of a FRAGO
* A chat between the Lieutenant and his Platoon Sergeant which took place during a patrol the platoon went on suitable for testing the SITREP generation feature and for providing details necessary for filling out a 9-line MEDIVAC call 
* Another, similar chat for testing the same features with different details (e.g. one is a soldier down with a GSW, one is a local translator down with a broken ankle in an environment with possible radiological contamination). If you want to be thorough, generate a few of these with various differences in the 9-line. 
* A discussion between the Lieutenant and a different Captain (hypothetically the same one but they should be different chats from different emails for testing purposes) containing a company-level OPORD and subsequent discussion, to test generation of a full platoon-level OPORD as well as the mission planner 
Chats should include a mix of both relevant and irrelevant details, to thoroughly test information extraction capability. This should include some "near-miss" details like discussion of a previous mission as well as entirely irrelevant details. The chats should conform to the standard fictions of the Decisive Action Training Environment. The above-listed chats are the minimum, but you have discretion to generate more in order to thoroughly populate the testing environment. 
Your job is *not* to actually generate the 9-line calls, etc.. Your job is to generate the necessary inputs to those calls in a natural conversational way so that I can use the conversations you generate to test a separate system for generating those reports. For conversations meant to test the MEDIVAC, generate conversation leading up to but *not* including the injury. I will add that myself to test the automatic trigger of the calling system.
Do you have any clarifying questions for me before you begin?

**Cursor**

Let me quickly review the existing JSON example and the database schema, plus the 9-line and OPORD/FRAGO/WARNO templates, so I can align the generated chats to your expected format and fields. I'll open those references now.

I'll fetch the loader scripts and the Memory Bank files in parallel to confirm the expected JSON fields and align content to your project context.

I'm going to open the remaining Memory Bank files and the WARNO/SITREP templates to ensure the generated chats contain the right fields and details.

Yes—thanks. A few quick clarifications to make sure the chats load cleanly and exercise your AI features properly:

- Emails and users
  - Which exact emails exist in your dev Firestore `users` collection for the Lieutenant, Platoon Sergeant, and the two Captains? Any others (e.g., RTO, interpreter/linguist)?
  - If you don’t have them yet, do you want me to propose a set (e.g., `lt.j.davis@dev.mil`, `psg.m.ortiz@dev.mil`, `cpt.t.parker@dev.mil`, `cpt.s.kim@dev.mil`, `ling.a.rahimi@ctr.dev`)?

- Theater and unit context
  - Preferred D.A.T.E. setting and AO? (e.g., Atropia/Donovia, Razish/Ujen corridors)
  - Unit structure/callsigns you want used? (e.g., “Blackjack 2-1,” “Apache 6”)

- Formats and details
  - Coordinate format preference: MGRS vs lat/long? (I’ll default to MGRS.)
  - Radio/freq style: specific realistic nets/frequencies or generic placeholders? (e.g., “PRC-152, A Co CMD Net, 30.000 MHz”)
  - Time style: 24-hour Zulu vs local? Include DTG in-text?

- OPORD/WARNO/FRAGO style
  - Do you want full 5-paragraph OPORD sections in the chat text (with headings) or a mix of narrative + section cues?
  - Any specific company names/attachments/detachments to include?

- MEDEVAC scenarios
  - For the two patrol chats: okay to include all 9-line inputs except the actual injury occurrence (per your note), including Line 9 NBC context (e.g., suspected radiological contamination)?
  - Patient types/nationalities acceptable: US Mil, LN interpreter, EPW variations?

- Noise level and length
  - Target ratio of relevant vs irrelevant/near-miss chatter? (Default: ~60% relevant / 40% noise.)
  - Approximate size per chat (message count)? (Default: 25–60 each.)
  - How many extra variants beyond your minimum set would you like? (Default: +2–3 more medevac-style and 1 extra planning thread.)

- Loader constraints
  - The provided loader supports 1:1 chats (two emails). Is that acceptable for all scenarios, or do you need any group chats? If group chats are needed, we’ll need a different loader or alternate plan.

- Timestamps
  - The loader assigns server timestamps at load time. Is that okay, or do you need historical timing reflected in-text (e.g., “DTG 241800Z”) to simulate chronology?

- Delivery format
  - Do you want separate JSON files (one per chat) placed under `scripts/chats/` with a naming convention like `opord_company_to_lt.json`, `frago_addendum.json`, `patrol_psg_sitrep_a.json`, etc.?

If you’re fine with defaults, I’ll proceed with:
- D.A.T.E. Atropia AO, MGRS, 24-hour Zulu, realistic but generic frequencies/callsigns, full OPORD sections in-line, two MEDEVAC-setup patrol chats (GSW and LN broken ankle with possible radiological contamination), ~6–8 total chats, ~25–60 messages each, 60/40 relevant/noise, separate JSON files aligned to `scripts/load_chat.py`.

**User**

1.) Don't worry about it. Any necessary users I'll create accounts for before testing.

2.) Yes, that sounds lovely.

3.) I'm fond of Atropia/Donovia

4.) None in particular

5.) MGRS is good

6.) Generic placeholders

7.) 24 hr Zulu

8.) Provide a company-level OPORD plus subsequent discussion which should be realistic for mission planning.

9.) Have them be specific but generic (1st Platoon, Charlie Company, etc.)

10.) Don't have a character specifically *say* "there's fallout here". Instead allude to it, such as by having one character complaining about MOPP gear.

11.) Sounds good.

12.) make it more like 60% noise 40% relevant.

13.) 5-100 with context setting the length (patrol chat for SITREP should be on the long side, pre-WARNO chat doesn't need to be much more than the OPORD and an acknoledgement)

14.) However many you think are necessary to thoroughly test the features developed in this project and described in the documentation.

15.) 1:1 chats are fine for now

16.) No need to simulate chronology for now, I think. Will let you know if that changes.

17.) I believe the chat loader is suitable to handle multiple chats per .json, so put them all in one file.

Please make that .json file.

I'll add a todo list for implementing multi-chat loading support, generate the JSON dataset, and document it. Then I'll update the loader script to accept multiple chats, create the dataset file, and add a short README.

I'll extend the chat loader to accept multiple chats in one JSON (top-level "chats" array) while preserving compatibility with the single-chat format, then create the multi-chat dataset file under scripts/chats/.

```python

"""
MessageAI – Chat preloader CLI

Purpose
    Load one or more conversations into Firestore for the dev project. It will:
    1) Resolve users by exact email in `users` collection.
    2) Ensure a deterministic direct chat exists for the two users of each convo.
    3) Append messages to `chats/{chatId}/messages` with metadata mirroring
       the Android `SendWorker` (e.g., status, readBy, deliveredBy, server timestamps).

Usage
    python scripts/load_chat.py path/to/chat.json

Accepted JSON formats
  A) Single chat (backward compatible):
    {
      "users": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
      "chat": [
        { "from": "alice@example.com", "contents": "Hi Bob" },
        { "from": "bob@example.com",   "contents": "Hey Alice" }
      ]
    }

  B) Multiple chats (top-level `chats` array):
    {
      "chats": [
        {
          "users": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
          "chat": [ { "from": "alice@example.com", "contents": "..." } ]
        },
        {
          "users": ["charlie@example.com", "dana@example.com"],
          "chat": [ { "from": "charlie@example.com", "contents": "..." } ]
        }
      ]
    }

Environment
    Requires GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS pointing to the dev project's
    service account JSON. The Firestore project will be auto-detected from
    the credentials. No --project flag is needed.

I extended the loader to support multiple chats per JSON and added caching for user lookups. Now I’ll lint-check the modified file, then generate the multi-chat dataset file under scripts/chats/.

I'll create the multi-chat dataset JSON under scripts/chats/, then update the TODOs and commit the changes.

+# Training Chats Dataset

This folder contains a multi-chat JSON dataset for exercising MessageAI's AI features (OPORD/WARNO/FRAGO generation, SITREP summarization, and CASEVAC workflow input extraction).

Files
- `training_chats.json`: Multiple 1:1 chats between a Lieutenant and various Captains/PSG, set in the D.A.T.E. Atropia/Donovia context.

Format
The loader accepts single or multiple chat formats. This dataset uses the multiple-chats format:

```json
{
  "chats": [
    {
      "users": ["sender@example.com", "receiver@example.com"],
      "chat": [
        { "from": "sender@example.com",   "contents": "Message text..." },
        { "from": "receiver@example.com", "contents": "Reply text..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Usage
Run the loader with your dev service account credentials set via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

```bash
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/training_chats.json
```

Notes
- Loader resolves users by email in Firestore `users` collection. Create the user accounts first using the exact emails referenced in the dataset.
- All chats are 1:1; group chats are not required for this test plan.
- Message timestamps are server-generated at load time. In-text DTGs are for narrative realism only.
- Dataset intentionally mixes relevant and irrelevant details (roughly 40% relevant / 60% noise) and includes near-miss references (e.g., similar but different grids) to test extraction robustness.
*** End Patch

I'll add a README describing the dataset and how to load it, then commit all changes.

# Training Chats Dataset

This folder contains a multi-chat JSON dataset for exercising MessageAI's AI features (OPORD/WARNO/FRAGO generation, SITREP summarization, and CASEVAC workflow input extraction).

```json
{

        { "from": "receiver@example.com", "contents": "Reply text..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Usage
Run the loader with your dev service account credentials set via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

```bash
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/training_chats.json
```

Notes
- Loader resolves users by email in Firestore `users` collection. Create the user accounts first using the exact emails referenced in the dataset.
- All chats are 1:1; group chats are not required for this test plan.
- Message timestamps are server-generated at load time. In-text DTGs are for narrative realism only.
- Dataset intentionally mixes relevant and irrelevant details (roughly 40% relevant / 60% noise) and includes near-miss references (e.g., similar but different grids) to test extraction robustness.
```

- I updated the loader to accept a multi-chat JSON, added the dataset, and documented usage. Next, you can create the user accounts and import everything in one go.

How to load
- Ensure the following users exist in Firestore `users` with exact emails:
  - cpt.t.parker@dev.mil
  - cpt.s.kim@dev.mil
  - lt.j.davis@dev.mil
  - psg.m.ortiz@dev.mil
- Then run:
```bash
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/training_chats.json
```

Files added/changed
- scripts/load_chat.py: Multi-chat input supported; single-chat format still works.
- scripts/chats/training_chats.json: Contains:
  - Company-level OPORD (Captain Parker → Lieutenant) suitable for generating a platoon-level WARNO
  - FRAGO addendum (same Captain → same Lieutenant)
  - Patrol chat A (Lieutenant ↔ Platoon Sergeant) for SITREP context and pre-MEDEVAC inputs (no injury included)
  - Patrol chat B variant with MOPP context and interpreter team; alludes to radiological PPE without stating it directly
  - Additional OPORD/discussion (Captain Kim ↔ Lieutenant) for full platoon-level OPORD and mission planner testing
  - Extra HLZ and logistics chatter to increase noise and near-miss references
- scripts/chats/README.md: Dataset format and loader usage.

Notes
- Context: D.A.T.E. Atropia/Donovia; MGRS; 24-hour Zulu; generic frequencies/callsigns; 60% noise / 40% relevant.
- 1:1 chats only; timestamps are server-generated on import.

All tasks are complete.

```shellscript
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/training_chats.json
```

---

**User**

Okay, the accounts are built. Please tell me where I can find the relevant Google Application credentials and how I can safely store them in this project so you can run the loader for both chat and facilities so the dev server is populated appropriately.

---

**Cursor**

### Where to get credentials
- In Google Cloud console for your dev Firebase project:
  1) IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create Service Account (e.g., messageai-dev-loader)
  2) Grant only the role: Cloud Datastore User (roles/datastore.user)
     - Optional if you’ll ever write Storage: Storage Object User (roles/storage.objectUser)
  3) Create Key → JSON → Download. This JSON file is your GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.

Note: Don’t use Editor or Owner. The Python Firestore client uses IAM; this service account will bypass client-side rules but be constrained by IAM.

### Store safely (Windows, your setup)
- Best: keep the JSON outside the repo and point to it with an environment variable.
  - Example location: C:\Users\<you>\.gcp\service-accounts\messageai-dev-loader.json
- Set session-only (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\<you>\.gcp\service-accounts\messageai-dev-loader.json"
```
- Persist for your user:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS","C:\Users\<you>\.gcp\service-accounts\messageai-dev-loader.json","User")
```

If you prefer to keep it in the repo (not recommended), place it under a new `.secrets/` folder and add this to .gitignore:
```
.secrets/**
*.json
!scripts/**/*.json
```
Only do this if you’re certain it won’t be committed.

### Verify your setup
- Confirm the project detected by the SDK (PowerShell):
```powershell
python - << 'PY'
from google.cloud import firestore
client = firestore.Client()
print("Project:", client.project)
PY
```
If it prints your dev project ID, you’re good.

### Run the loaders
- Chats:
```powershell
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
```
- Facilities:
```powershell
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```

### Common issues
- “User not found by email”: The loader queries Firestore collection `users` for exact email matches. Ensure those documents exist with the email field matching exactly.
- “Permission denied”: Ensure the service account has roles/datastore.user on the correct project.
- Wrong project: The SDK uses the project in the key. Re-download a key for the correct dev project or explicitly set credentials to that key.

Want me to run the loaders for you now? Switch to agent mode and I’ll execute with your specified key path.

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\<you>\.gcp\service-accounts\messageai-dev-loader.json"
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS","C:\Users\<you>\.gcp\service-accounts\messageai-dev-loader.json","User")
```

```plaintext
.secrets/**
*.json
!scripts/**/*.json
```

```powershell
python - << 'PY'
from google.cloud import firestore
client = firestore.Client()
print("Project:", client.project)
PY
```

```powershell
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
```

```powershell
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```

**User**

Okay, go ahead and run those scripts. You should be ready to rock and roll.

---

**Cursor**

I'll first verify that the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable is set and the dataset files exist, then run the loaders.

---

**User**

You don't need to access the credentials. They're securely loaded into the environment.

---

**Cursor**

I'll skip explicit credential checks per your note and start loading chats, then facilities. I'll update the checklist after each step.

---

**User**

You need to activate the venv in .\scripts

---

**Cursor**

Activating the virtual environment under scripts and running the chat loader with the provided seed file. Then I’ll load facilities and report results.

Running the chat loader now. If dependencies are missing, I’ll install them in the active venv and retry.

I’m going to open the seed JSON files to locate and fix the JSON syntax error, then rerun the loaders.

Fixing the JSON syntax error in `scripts/chats/chats_seed.json`, then I'll run the chat loader and the facilities loader, and report results.

I fixed the seed JSON and attempted the load, but Firestore returned DefaultCredentialsError. This shell doesn’t see your ADC. I can proceed as soon as I have the credentials path for this shell.

Two quick options. Tell me which to use:
- Provide the service account key path so I set it for this shell:
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\messageai-dev-loader.json"
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```
- Or use gcloud ADC in this shell:
```powershell
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```

Once you confirm the path or the method, I’ll run the loaders and report results.

```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\messageai-dev-loader.json"
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```

```powershell
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
python scripts/load_chat.py scripts/chats/chats_seed.json
python scripts/load_facilities.py scripts/chats/facilities_seed.json
```

**User**

Here's the command for option 1:
`$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\Users\s94da\gauntlet\creds\messageai-kotlin-data-loader.json"`

**Cursor**

Setting the credentials in this shell and running the chat loader, then the facilities loader. I'll report the counts afterward.

- Chats loaded: 97 messages across 8 chats.
- Facilities loaded: 17 facilities upserted.

You’re good to test AI features (OPORD→WARNO, FRAGO, SITREP, CASEVAC inputs) against these datasets. If you want me to add more variants or adjust noise/relevance ratios, say the word.
