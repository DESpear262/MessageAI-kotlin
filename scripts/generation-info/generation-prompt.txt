Here's a .json format to populate the database table of existing chats. Please use it to generate a set of chats suitable for testing the AI features of this project, between the Lieutenant hypothetical user and various individuals in his orbit. 
A minimum set of chats I want to see: 
* One which contains an OPORD for a company-level element which will be used for testing generation of a platoon-level WARNO
 * Another from the same Captain to the same Lieutenant containing an addendum suitable for generation of a FRAGO
* A chat between the Lieutenant and his Platoon Sergeant which took place during a patrol the platoon went on suitable for testing the SITREP generation feature and for providing details necessary for filling out a 9-line MEDIVAC call 
* Another, similar chat for testing the same features with different details (e.g. one is a soldier down with a GSW, one is a local translator down with a broken ankle in an environment with possible radiological contamination). If you want to be thorough, generate a few of these with various differences in the 9-line. 
* A discussion between the Lieutenant and a different Captain (hypothetically the same one but they should be different chats from different emails for testing purposes) containing a company-level OPORD and subsequent discussion, to test generation of a full platoon-level OPORD as well as the mission planner 
Chats should include a mix of both relevant and irrelevant details, to thoroughly test information extraction capability. This should include some "near-miss" details like discussion of a previous mission as well as entirely irrelevant details. The chats should conform to the standard fictions of the Decisive Action Training Environment. The above-listed chats are the minimum, but you have discretion to generate more in order to thoroughly populate the testing environment. 
Your job is *not* to actually generate the 9-line calls, etc.. Your job is to generate the necessary inputs to those calls in a natural conversational way so that I can use the conversations you generate to test a separate system for generating those reports. For conversations meant to test the MEDIVAC, generate conversation leading up to but *not* including the injury. I will add that myself to test the automatic trigger of the calling system.
Do you have any clarifying questions for me before you begin?
