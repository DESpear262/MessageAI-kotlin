# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Sprint 2 AI Integration: ✅ ALL CORE BLOCKS COMPLETE & QC APPROVED (A, B, B2, C, D)
  - Block A: AI Core module ✅ COMPLETE & QC APPROVED
  - Block B: Firebase Functions AI gateway ✅ COMPLETE & QC APPROVED
  - Block B2: LangChain Service ✅ COMPLETE & QC APPROVED
  - Block C: Geo Intelligence ✅ COMPLETE & QC APPROVED
  - Block D: Reporting ✅ COMPLETE & QC APPROVED

## Recent Changes
- **QC completed for Blocks C & D:**
  - Comprehensive code review report created (`docs/reviews/BLOCKS_C_D_QC_REPORT.md`)
  - Block C: GeoService with AI integration, threat extraction, geofencing
  - Block D: ReportService with SITREP & NATO templates (WARNORD, OPORD, FRAGO)
  - Both blocks properly integrate with AIService and LangChainAdapter
  - Status: ✅ APPROVED FOR MVP DEPLOYMENT
- LangChain FastAPI service with endpoints: template, threats, sitrep, intent, workflow
- CF AI Gateway with three-tier architecture:
  - `aiRouter` at `/v1/*` (production-grade with full security)
  - `aiRouterSimple?path=...` (development/testing)
  - `openaiProxy` (legacy support)

## Next Steps
- Deploy LangChain service to Cloud Run/GKE (private network)
- Configure production environment variables:
  - `LANGCHAIN_BASE_URL` in Cloud Functions
  - `LANGCHAIN_SHARED_SECRET` in Cloud Functions secrets
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for CORS
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` in LangChain service
  - `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID` in LangChain service
- Update Android `BuildConfig.CF_BASE_URL` to production Firebase Function URL
- Conduct end-to-end smoke testing (Android → CF → LangChain → response)

## Risks
- In-memory rate limiting resets on cold start (acceptable for MVP)
- In-memory RAG cache (no persistence between requests)
- All limitations documented and acceptable for MVP
