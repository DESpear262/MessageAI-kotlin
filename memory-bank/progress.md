### MVP Sprint (Complete)
- Block C: Firestore models/paths, LWW utils, mappers, services — done.
- Block D: Paging 3, RemoteMediator, Room indices/remote keys, repository — done.
- Block E: Realtime listeners, delivered/read receipts, RTDB presence/typing, 1:1 chat list + chat UI — done.
- Block F: Group chat — done (unified list, group create/rename, sender attribution per bubble, presence header).
- Block G: Media (images) — done (gallery + camera, upload, inline render, prefetch).
- Block I: Offline support & send queue — done.
- Block J: Presence indicator dots — done.

## What Works
- **AI Integration (Sprint 2 - COMPLETE):** 
  - Block A: Provider-swappable architecture; RAG context from Room; LangChain adapter; secure token handling; offline queue; LocalProvider for testing; 32 unit tests (100% pass)
  - Block B: Firebase Functions proxy with auth, rate limiting, HMAC signing, CORS, timeout controls; TypeScript compiles cleanly
  - Block B2: FastAPI LangChain service with 5 AI endpoints, RAG, Firestore integration, OpenAI, Docker containerization
  - End-to-end data contracts verified; Postman collection ready
- **Core Chat:** Text send pipeline; image pipeline; UI image rendering; WorkManager + Hilt integration; presence dots via RTDB.
- **Test Suite:** 71/72 tests passing (98% success rate); Block A tests 100% (32/32).

## What's Next (Deployment)
Sprint 2 AI Integration is code-complete. Next steps:
- Deploy LangChain service to Cloud Run/GKE in private VPC
- Configure production environment variables (see QC report for checklist)
- Update Android `BuildConfig.CF_BASE_URL` to production Firebase Function URL
- Conduct end-to-end smoke testing
- Optional enhancements (per QC recommendations):
  - Add unit tests (pytest for Python, Jest for TypeScript)
  - Implement persistent RAG cache (Redis/Pinecone)
  - Add circuit breaker pattern to proxy
  - Enable Swagger/OpenAPI docs
  - Add structured logging with correlation IDs

## Known Issues / Notes
- Indeterminate progress for uploads (acceptable for MVP).
- Security rules pending coordination; test media strictly in dev until policies land.
- 1 AuthViewModel test fails (pre-existing Android mocking issue, low priority).
