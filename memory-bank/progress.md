# Progress

## Status Overview
### Sprint 2 - AI Integration
- **Block A: AI Core Module** â€” âœ… COMPLETE
  - Provider interface & facade pattern
  - RAG context builder with configurable windows
  - LangChain HTTP adapter (5 endpoints)
  - Hilt DI with Firebase Auth integration
  - WorkManager offline queue
  - 32 unit tests (100% pass)
  - Developer README + QC report
- **Block B: AI Gateway (Cloud Functions)** â€” âœ… COMPLETE
  - `aiRouter` (/v1/*) with ID token verification, HMAC signing, payload cap, rate limits, structured logs, timeouts
  - `aiRouterSimple?path=...` for local testing; defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` when env unset
- **Block B2: LangChain Service** â€” ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS (running locally)
  - FastAPI service scaffolded with all endpoints + envelopes
  - Firestore reader stub + in-memory RAG cache
  - OpenAI integration (mock if no key)
  - SITREP summarization using RAG + LLM
  - Dockerfile, requirements, README added
  - Postman collection and docs hooks added

### MVP Sprint (Complete)
- Block C: Firestore models/paths, LWW utils, mappers, services â€” done.
- Block D: Paging 3, RemoteMediator, Room indices/remote keys, repository â€” done.
- Block E: Realtime listeners, delivered/read receipts, RTDB presence/typing, 1:1 chat list + chat UI â€” done.
- Block F: Group chat â€” done (unified list, group create/rename, sender attribution per bubble, presence header).
- Block G: Media (images) â€” done (gallery + camera, upload, inline render, prefetch).
- Block I: Offline support & send queue â€” done.
- Block J: Presence indicator dots â€” done.

## What Works
- **AI Module (NEW):** Provider-swappable architecture; RAG context from Room; LangChain adapter; secure token handling; offline queue; LocalProvider for testing.
- **LangChain Service (NEW):** Health endpoint; envelopes; SITREP summarization; CF routing; Dockerized.
- **Core Chat:** Text send pipeline; image pipeline; UI image rendering; WorkManager + Hilt integration; presence dots via RTDB.
- **Test Suite:** 71/72 tests passing (98% success rate); Block A tests 100% (32/32).

## What's Next (Immediate)
- Optionally deploy service to Cloud Run; configure `LANGCHAIN_BASE_URL` in CF
- Provide Firestore sample data and run QC plan
- Implement threats extraction and template autofill with RAG
- For Android emulator, set `CF_BASE_URL` to `http://10.0.2.2:5001/messageai-kotlin/us-central1/`

## Known Issues / Notes
- Indeterminate progress for uploads (acceptable for MVP).
- Security rules pending coordination; test media strictly in dev until policies land.
- 1 AuthViewModel test fails (pre-existing Android mocking issue, low priority).
