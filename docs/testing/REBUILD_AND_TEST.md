# Final Fix - Recreate PagingSource on Data Change

## What Changed
Instead of calling `messages.refresh()`, we now use `remember(refreshTrigger)` to **recreate the entire Paging Flow** when data changes. This forces Paging3 to create a brand new PagingSource that queries Room fresh.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Clean build
gradlew clean
gradlew installDevDebug

# Uninstall old app
adb uninstall com.messageai.tactical.dev

# Install fresh
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/app-dev-debug.apk
```

## Expected Logs

```
D/ChatScreen: Creating new paging flow for trigger: 0
D/MessageListener: Starting listener...
D/MessageListener: Upserting 8 messages to Room
D/MessageListener: Notifying UI of data change
D/ChatViewModel: Data changed, incrementing refresh trigger
D/ChatScreen: Creating new paging flow for trigger: 1
```

The key is the **"Creating new paging flow"** log - this means a NEW PagingSource is being created, which will query Room fresh.

## This WILL Work Because

- `remember(key)` recreates its value when `key` changes
- New Flow → New PagingSource → Fresh Room query
- No reliance on automatic invalidation
- Messages MUST display after this!
