## MVP
- Real-time messaging: PASS (two devices/emulators)
- Offline queue + retry: PASS (airplane mode; WorkManager replay)
- Foreground notifications: PASS (CF emulator â†’ FCM)
- Persistence: PASS (Room loads history; crash/force-quit resilience)

## Sprint 2 AI
- Templates (WARNORD/OPORD/FRAGO): PASS (markdown generated via LangChain)
- SITREP summarize: PASS (<10s target)
- Threat extraction: PASS (single-message + chat window)
- Assistant router: PASS (decision JSON; tool exec paths)
- CASEVAC workflow: PASS (<60s warm; tasks persisted)

## Performance (warm targets)

- SITREP: <10s
- Threats: <5s
- CASEVAC: <60s

## Artifacts
