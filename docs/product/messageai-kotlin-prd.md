## Data Schema

### User Document
```kotlin
data class User(
    val uid: String,
    val email: String,
    val displayName: String,
    val photoURL: String? = null,
    val createdAt: Timestamp,
    val lastSeen: Timestamp,
    val isOnline: Boolean = false,
    val fcmToken: String? = null
)
```

### Chat Document (One-on-One)
```kotlin
data class Chat(
    val id: String,
    val participants: List<String>, // User IDs
    val participantDetails: Map<String, ParticipantInfo>,
    val lastMessage: LastMessage? = null,
    val createdAt: Timestamp,
    val updatedAt: Timestamp
)

data class ParticipantInfo(
    val name: String,
    val photoUrl: String?
)

data class LastMessage(
    val text: String,
    val senderId: String,
    val timestamp: Timestamp
)
```

### Message Document
```kotlin
data class Message(
    val id: String,
    val chatId: String,
    val senderId: String,
    val text: String,
    val imageUrl: String? = null,
    val timestamp: Timestamp,
    val status: MessageStatus,
    val readBy: List<String> = emptyList(), // For group chats
    val localOnly: Boolean = false // For optimistic updates
)

enum class MessageStatus {

    val memberDetails: Map<String, ParticipantInfo>,
    val createdBy: String,
    val createdAt: Timestamp,
    val lastMessage: LastMessage? = null
)
```

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Note**: Include `metadata: Map<String, Any>` field in all documents for extensibility (roles, permissions, encryption keys, geolocation data, etc.).

---

## Local Database Schema (Room)

### Message Entity
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "messages")
data class MessageEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val chatId: String,
    val senderId: String,
    val text: String?,
    val imageUrl: String?,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val status: String,
    val readBy: String, // JSON array
    val synced: Boolean = false,
    val createdAt: Long
)
```

### Chat Entity
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "chats")
data class ChatEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val type: String, // 'direct' or 'group'
    val name: String?,
    val participants: String, // JSON array
    val lastMessage: String?,
    val lastMessageTime: Long?,
    val unreadCount: Int = 0,
    val updatedAt: Long
)
```

### SendQueue Entity
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "send_queue")
data class SendQueueEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val messageId: String,
    val chatId: String,
    val retryCount: Int = 0,
    val createdAt: Long
)
```

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Note**: Design schema to support message expiration timestamps (for self-destruct), geolocation metadata, and mesh routing information post-MVP. Room's migration system will make schema evolution straightforward.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Modular AI Integration
**Decision**: Create `ai` module with clean interface for swapping providers

**Structure**:
```
/modules
  /ai
    /providers
      OpenAIProvider.kt      // OpenAI implementation
      LocalProvider.kt       // Placeholder for local LLM
    AIService.kt             // Interface
    AITypes.kt
```

**Rationale**: Allows clean swap from OpenAI API ‚Üí local/HQ-hosted LLM post-prototype

---

### 2. Modular Encryption
**Decision**: Abstract encryption into swappable module with consistent interface

**Structure**:
```
/modules
  /encryption
    /providers
      AES32Provider.kt       // 32-bit AES (prototype)
      SignalProvider.kt      // Signal Protocol (production)
    EncryptionService.kt
    EncryptionTypes.kt
```

**Implementation**:
- Use Android Keystore for secure key storage from day 1
- Interface design supports key exchange protocols

**Rationale**: Prototype with basic encryption, swap to Signal Protocol or military-grade later. Android Keystore provides hardware-backed security.

---

### 3. Message Queue Architecture
**Decision**: Implement persistent queue with WorkManager for retry logic

**Implementation**:
- Messages save to Room database immediately
- WorkManager schedules sync tasks with exponential backoff
- Queue processes on app foreground/network change
- OneTimeWorkRequest for individual message sends
- PeriodicWorkRequest for batch sync

**Rationale**: Ensures no message loss and prepares for mesh networking where queuing is critical. WorkManager is superior to manual background services for reliability and battery optimization.

---

### 4. Media Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Store media metadata alongside messages, with local caching via Coil

**Implementation**:
- Upload to Firebase Storage
- Store URL in message document
- Coil handles local caching automatically
- Metadata supports future geolocation pins

**Rationale**: Extensible to other media types (voice, video, geolocation pins). Coil's caching system is production-ready and battery-efficient.

---

### 5. Dependency Injection with Hilt
**Decision**: Use Hilt for dependency injection from MVP

**Rationale**: 
- Clean architecture with testable components
- Essential for swapping modules (AI providers, encryption providers)
- Reduces boilerplate compared to manual DI
- Industry standard for Android development

---

### 6. Bluetooth/WiFi-Direct Preparation
**Decision**: Abstract network transport layer to support multiple transports

**Structure**:
```
/network
  /transports
    FirestoreTransport.kt    // MVP implementation
    BluetoothTransport.kt    // Future
    WiFiDirectTransport.kt   // Future
  NetworkService.kt          // Interface
```

**Rationale**: Android's native Bluetooth and WiFi-Direct APIs are first-class. Designing transport abstraction now makes mesh networking integration straightforward post-MVP.

---

## Testing Requirements

### MVP Test Scenarios
1. **Real-time messaging**: Two emulators (or emulator + physical device) send messages back and forth
2. **Offline scenario**: Device A goes offline, Device B sends messages, Device A comes online and receives them
3. **Background/Foreground**: Send message while app backgrounded, verify notification and sync
4. **Force-quit**: Force-quit app mid-send, reopen, verify message sends via WorkManager
5. **Poor network**: Throttle connection, send 20+ rapid messages, verify all deliver
6. **Group chat**: 3 participants send messages, verify all receive and read receipts work
7. **Image sending**: Send image from gallery, verify appears for recipient
8. **Persistence**: Send messages, force-quit app, reopen, verify history loads from Room
