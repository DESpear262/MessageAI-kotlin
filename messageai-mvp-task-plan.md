# Post-MVP Roadmap

## Week 2 â€“ Tactical UX

 - [ ] Hardware-backed keys (Keystore) from day 1 in Kotlin

## Week 4 â€“ AI Assist
- [ ] AI chat, template generation, summarization, action extraction; provider-swappable interface

## Future â€“ Mesh Prep
- [ ] Transport abstraction over Firestore; future Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct transports  
- [ ] Offline multi-hop relay + routing

---

## Tiny Stack Diffs (only where it matters)

- **Secure storage:** Android Keystore  
- **Local DB:** Room (DAOs, migrations)  
- **Images:** MediaStore/Coil  
- **Queue/background:** WorkManager  
- **Notifications:** Notification channels + intents

## Recommended Execution Strategy

**Day 1 (8h):** A, B, C, D â†’ baseline running  
**Day 2 (10h):** E core (chat list + send/receive + states) + I queue; start J  
**Day 3 (6â€“8h):** F groups + G media + H notifications; K tests; L packaging
