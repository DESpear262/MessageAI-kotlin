## 🧪 Testing Status

### Manual Test Checklist

#### ✅ Core Message Flow (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **MUST TEST:** Send message device A → appears on device B immediately
- [ ] **MUST TEST:** Message persists in Firestore (verify in console)
- [ ] **MUST TEST:** Message displays in UI without refresh

#### Groups (Block F)
- [ ] Create 3-member group
- [ ] Send message in group → all see it with sender attribution
- [ ] Rename group → all see new name
- [ ] Verify read receipts show who read

#### Images (Block G)
- [ ] Pick image from gallery → sends successfully
- [ ] Take photo with camera → sends successfully
- [ ] Large image (>2MB) → resizes appropriately
- [ ] Image cached for offline viewing

#### Notifications (Block H)
- [ ] Receive message in foreground → in-app banner shows
- [ ] Receive message in background → system notification shows
- [ ] Tap in-app banner → opens correct chat
- [ ] FCM token updates in Firestore on login

#### Offline/Queue (Block I)
- [ ] Enable airplane mode → send message
- [ ] Message shows "SENDING" locally
- [ ] Disable airplane mode → message sends automatically
- [ ] Force-quit during send → message survives restart

### Unit Tests Created
- ✅ TimeUtilsTest (9 tests)
- ✅ FirestorePathsTest (8 tests)
- ✅ MapperTest (16 tests)
- ✅ RootViewModelTest (6 tests)
- ✅ AuthViewModelTest (11 tests)
- ✅ DaoTest (15 tests)

**Total:** 65 test cases

## 📋 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Still TODO (Not Blocking MVP)

1. **System notification missing PendingIntent** ⚠️
   - **Impact:** Tap on background notification doesn't open chat
   - **Severity:** Medium (in-app banner works)
   - **Recommendation:** Add before production

2. **No notification permission request (API 33+)** ⚠️
   - **Impact:** Silent failure on Android 13+
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Recommendation:** Add permission request flow

3. **No read receipt throttling** ⚠️
   - **Impact:** Excessive Firestore writes on scroll
   - **Severity:** Low (cost issue, not functional)
   - **Recommendation:** Debounce 500ms

4. **No FCM token revocation on logout** 🔒
   - **Impact:** Privacy leak (old device gets notifications)
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Recommendation:** Clear token in Firestore on logout

5. **Firestore security rules not verified** 🔒
   - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access
   - **Severity:** HIGH for production
   - **Recommendation:** Review and test rules before deploy

## ✅ Sign-Off Criteria

### Blocking Issues: ALL RESOLVED ✅
- ✅ Messages write to Firestore correctly
- ✅ Messages read from Firestore correctly
- ✅ Messages display in realtime in UI
- ✅ All workers have error logging
- ✅ Image uploads include senderId
- ✅ Group creation validates creator membership
- ✅ No linter errors

### Test Verification Required
**User MUST test before proceeding:**

1. Install app on two devices
2. Login on both devices
3. Device A sends message to Device B
4. **VERIFY:** Message appears on Device B within 1 second
5. **VERIFY:** Message persists in Firestore (check Firebase console)
6. **VERIFY:** No errors in LogCat

**If any of the above fail, DO NOT PROCEED.**

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Install & Monitor
```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor logs for errors
adb logcat | grep -E "(SendWorker|MessageListener|ImageUpload)"

# Terminal 2: Install app
cd app
./gradlew installDevDebug
```

### Step 2: Test Core Flow
1. Open app on Device A, login as User A
2. Open app on Device B, login as User B
3. Device A: Create chat with User B
4. Device A: Send message "Test 1"
5. **VERIFY on Device B:** Message "Test 1" appears within 1 second
6. Device B: Send reply "Test 2"
7. **VERIFY on Device A:** Reply "Test 2" appears within 1 second

### Step 3: Test Offline
1. Device A: Enable airplane mode
2. Device A: Send message "Offline test"
3. **VERIFY:** Message shows "SENDING" status locally
4. Device A: Disable airplane mode
5. **VERIFY:** Message sends automatically within 5 seconds
6. **VERIFY on Device B:** Message received

### Step 4: Check Firestore
1. Open Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Navigate to `chats/{chatId}/messages`
3. **VERIFY:** All messages present with:
   - `id`, `chatId`, `senderId`, `text`
   - `timestamp` (server timestamp)
   - `readBy` (array, initially empty)
   - `deliveredBy` (array, initially empty)
   - `metadata` (null)
