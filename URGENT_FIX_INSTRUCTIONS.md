# URGENT: WorkManager + Hilt Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified ✅

**Error:** `NoSuchMethodException: SendWorker.<init> [Context, WorkerParameters]`

**Root Cause:** WorkManager was auto-initializing with the default factory instead of HiltWorkerFactory, so it couldn't instantiate `@HiltWorker` classes.

**Fix Applied:** Disabled WorkManager auto-initialization in AndroidManifest so the app's `Configuration.Provider` can supply HiltWorkerFactory.

---

## What Was Changed

### File: `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Added WorkManager initialization disabler:

```xml
<!-- Disable WorkManager auto-initialization so Hilt can provide the factory -->
<provider
    android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
    android:exported="false"
    tools:node="merge">
    <meta-data
        android:name="androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer"
        android:value="androidx.startup"
        tools:node="remove" />
</provider>
```

Also added `xmlns:tools` namespace to manifest root.

## REQUIRED STEPS - Do These NOW

### 1. Clean Build (CRITICAL)
```bash
cd app
./gradlew clean
```

### 2. Uninstall Old App from Device
```bash
adb uninstall com.messageai.tactical.dev
# or from device: Settings → Apps → MessageAI → Uninstall
```

### 3. Rebuild & Install
```bash
./gradlew installDevDebug
```

### 4. Monitor Logs While Testing
```bash
adb logcat -c  # Clear old logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(WM-Worker|SendWorker|MessageListener)"
```

### 5. Test Message Flow
1. Open app, login
2. Create chat or open existing chat
3. Send message: "Test after WorkManager fix"
4. **CHECK LOG:** Should see WorkManager creating worker successfully
5. **CHECK FIRESTORE:** Message should appear in console
6. **CHECK UI:** Message should display immediately

---

## What To Look For In Logs

### ✅ GOOD (What You SHOULD See):
```
SendWorker: Sending message {id} to chat {chatId}
SendWorker: Successfully sent message
MessageListener: Received snapshot with X documents
```

### ❌ BAD (Should NOT See):
```
WM-WorkerFactory: Could not instantiate
NoSuchMethodException
```

---

## If It Still Fails

### Check These:

1. **WorkManager dependency in build.gradle:**
   ```kotlin
   implementation("androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.0")
   implementation("androidx.hilt:hilt-work:1.1.0")
   ksp("androidx.hilt:hilt-compiler:1.1.0")
   ```

2. **MessageAiApp implements Configuration.Provider:**
   ```kotlin
   class MessageAiApp : Application(), Configuration.Provider {
       @Inject lateinit var workerFactory: HiltWorkerFactory
       
       override val workManagerConfiguration: Configuration
           get() = Configuration.Builder()
               .setWorkerFactory(workerFactory)
               .build()
   }
   ```

3. **Clean & Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   rm -rf app/build
   ./gradlew installDevDebug
   ```

---

## Why This Happened

1. WorkManager has automatic initialization by default
2. It initializes at app startup using default factory
3. Default factory can't create `@HiltWorker` classes (needs DI)
4. By the time Hilt provides HiltWorkerFactory, it's too late
5. Solution: Disable auto-init, let app provide factory via Configuration.Provider

---

## Expected Result After Fix

- ✅ SendWorker instantiates successfully
- ✅ Messages write to Firestore
- ✅ MessageListener receives updates
- ✅ Messages display in UI immediately
- ✅ No WorkManager errors in log

---

## If Messages Still Don't Show

After confirming WorkManager works (no more NoSuchMethodException), check:

1. **Firestore console** - Are messages actually written?
2. **MessageListener** - Is it receiving snapshot events?
3. **Room database** - Are entities being upserted?

Run debug query:
```bash
adb shell run-as com.messageai.tactical.dev
cd databases
sqlite3 messageai.db
SELECT * FROM messages;
.exit
```

---

**DO THIS NOW:** Clean build, uninstall, reinstall, test!
